### Project Description
A fun web platform where **anyone** can post random wishes — from *“I want a lifetime supply of bubble tea”* to *“A pink Lamborghini”*.  
Generous people (or just people with a good sense of humor) can browse wishes and anonymously fulfill them.  

🚫 **No direct contact** — everything is done via drop-shipping  
💌 **Wishes can be tagged**: funny, weird, wholesome, life-changing.

## 🤔 The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The world is full of unfulfilled wishes —  
from *“I want a lifetime supply of bubble tea”* to *“A banana signed by Gordon Ramsay.”*  
Are these needs urgent? No.  
Are they important? Absolutely not.  
But life’s too short to not make ridiculous dreams come true.
## 💡 The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing **Wishdump** — the platform where generous strangers (or bored rich people) can scroll through absurd, wholesome, or life-changing wishes and grant them... anonymously.
