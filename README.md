# Joyce’s Alphabet Wall ✨

A state-based communication system inspired by Stranger Things

Joyce’s Alphabet Wall reimagines the iconic Stranger Things communication method as a web-based system where two separate worlds communicate through shared state, not messages.

The Upside Down cannot speak, type, or send text.
It can only apply force to letters.
The Real World reconstructs meaning from the letters that react.

## Project Overview

Inspired by Stranger Things, Joyce’s Alphabet Wall is a symbolic communication system built around a single shared object: an alphabet wall.

Two distinct worlds exist.

-The Upside Down
Cannot send messages directly
Can only interact by selecting letters

-The Real World
Cannot see the sender
Can only observe letters lighting up

Communication happens one letter at a time, through state changes, not text.

## The Problem

Most communication systems assume direct visibility, shared language, and explicit messaging.

But what if two entities cannot see or hear each other and can only interact through a shared structure?

Traditional messaging fails under such constraints.

---

## The Solution

Joyce’s Alphabet Wall introduces state-based communication.

A 26-letter alphabet grid exists in both worlds.
The Upside Down can only select letters.
The Real World can only observe which letters glow.

Meaning is reconstructed visually, letter by letter.

## How It Works

Shared State
A real-time alphabet wall with letter states synced using Firebase.

Upside Down
Applies force to letters.
Cannot see the Real World.
Cannot send messages.

Real World
Watches letters glow.
Interprets meaning from the sequence.

Communication happens through state change, not direct data exchange.

## Why This Matters

The project explores indirect communication systems, constraint-based interaction design, and how meaning can emerge purely from shared state.

Sometimes, the message isn’t sent. It’s discovered.
