A Stranger Things–inspired communication system

Joyce’s Alphabet Wall is a web-based system where two separate worlds communicate through a shared alphabet wall.

The Upside Down cannot speak or send messages.
It can only interact by selecting letters.
The Real World sees letters light up and reconstructs meaning one letter at a time.

## Inspiration

Inspired by the Stranger Things alphabet wall, where communication happens through indirect interaction with a shared physical object rather than direct messaging.

---

## What it does

Provides a state-based communication system where one side selects letters and the other side interprets glowing letters to form meaning.

---

## How we built it

Built as a web application with a shared alphabet grid.
Letter states are synchronized in real time using Firebase to reflect interactions across both worlds.

---

## Challenges we ran into

Designing communication without direct messaging, maintaining real-time synchronization, and ensuring interactions remained simple and constrained.

---

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Successfully recreated indirect communication using only shared state and interaction, closely mirroring the original inspiration.

---

## What we learned

Learned about real-time state synchronization, constraint-based interaction design, and building meaning through minimal interfaces.

---

## What's next for Joyce’s Alphabet Wall

Adding multi-user support, improving visual feedback, and exploring other symbolic communication systems.
